    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Caldwell Kibe, a full-stack Software Engineer specializing in ML-driven systems and serverless architecture. I combine Python/Java backend expertise with AWS cloud services and research experience in distributed systems and computer vision.</p>

    <h2>Education & Background</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Informatics and Computer Science (First Class Honours) at Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya, graduating in July 2026. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, while my hands-on research experience has deepened my expertise in cutting-edge technologies.</p>

    <p>My educational experience has been enriched through research internships and real-world projects that have taught me the importance of scalable architecture, performance optimization, and collaborative development. I'm passionate about applying theoretical knowledge to solve complex, real-world problems.</p>

    <h2>Technical Skills & Expertise</h2>
    <p>My technical expertise spans multiple domains, with proficiency across the full technology stack:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proficient:</strong> Python, Java, Flask, PostgreSQL, React, AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB), Docker, Git</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Redis, Computer Vision, Machine Learning</li>
      <li><strong>Familiar:</strong> Kotlin, C++, Kubernetes, CI/CD, FastAPI, Spring Boot, D3.js</li>
      <li><strong>Specializations:</strong> ML-driven systems, Serverless architecture, Distributed systems, Real-time data processing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Experience & Achievements</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working as a Research & Development Intern at Strathmore University, where I've architected a high-performance Python backend processing 30 video frames/second for real-time gait detection. I've also delivered a React/D3.js performance dashboard that reduced incident detection time by 33%.</p>

    <p>Previously, as a Research Intern at the Centre of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAIL), I architected a distributed system processing 500MB+ daily bioacoustic data with 99.5% uptime and deployed ML models achieving 92% accuracy across 15+ bird species for biodiversity monitoring.</p>

    <h2>Career Goals & Passion Projects</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about leveraging technology for meaningful impact, particularly in areas like environmental monitoring, healthcare, and AI research. My current focus is on building scalable, fault-tolerant systems that can handle real-world data processing challenges at enterprise scale.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, I aim to continue advancing in full-stack development while deepening my expertise in machine learning and distributed systems. I'm particularly interested in opportunities that combine my technical skills with research and innovation. I actively contribute to open-source projects and have participated in competitive programs like the ASR Innovation Sprint, where I was selected from 200+ applicants to develop speech recognition for Kenyan languages.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy contributing to the tech community through open-source contributions and staying current with emerging technologies. I believe in continuous learning and the power of technology to create positive change in the world.</p>
