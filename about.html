    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in computer science and a dedication to creating innovative solutions that make a positive impact.</p>

    <h2>Background & Education</h2>
    <p>I am a final-year Computer Science student where I developed a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by the intersection of technology and problem-solving, which has driven me to continuously expand my knowledge and skills in various areas of software development.</p>

    <p>My educational experience has been complemented by hands-on projects and collaborative work that has taught me the importance of clean code, effective communication, and iterative development. I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying current with emerging technologies and industry best practices.</p>

    <h2>Technical Skills & Technologies</h2>
    
    <p>I have experience working with a diverse range of technologies and programming languages. My technical toolkit includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, Java, Dart, Javascript</li>
      <li><strong>Frameworks & Libraries:</strong> React, Node.js, Flutter</li>
      <li><strong>Database Technologies:</strong> MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
      <li><strong>Development Tools:</strong> Git, VS Code, Docker, Postman</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Platforms:</strong> AWS, Microsoft Azure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Passions & Career Goals</h2>
    <p>Beyond coding, I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and create meaningful user experiences. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and push the boundaries of what's possible with code. My interests span across web development, mobile applications, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, my career goals include becoming a full-stack developer who can architect and build scalable applications from conception to deployment. I aspire to work with diverse teams on projects that have a positive social impact, whether that's in healthcare, education, sustainability, or other areas where technology can make a difference. I'm also interested in eventually taking on leadership roles where I can mentor other developers and contribute to technical decision-making.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies through side projects, contributing to open-source initiatives, attending tech meetups, or enjoying outdoor activities that help me maintain a healthy work-life balance. I believe that diverse experiences and perspectives make me a better developer and collaborator.</p>
